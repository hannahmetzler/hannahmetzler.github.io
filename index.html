<p> I currently work as a psychologist in a psychosocial rehabilitation center, and am pursuing a postgraduate degree to become a clinical psychologist & therapist. Until recently, I worked as a psychological scientist and project lead at the Complexity Science Hub and Medical University of Vienna. My research focused on the area of social media and psycholgy. I used experiments and data science to investigate misinformation spreading, suicide prevention, and emotional wellbeing. I have a background in psychology and social and affective neuroscience.

<br>  <br>

I am part of the Open Science and the Effective Altruism community and strive to increase the transparency, reproducibility, and social impact of my work.
